## Problem Statement

It would give a great value to companies when they launch products and understand the sentiment of users through __different tweets__ and __comments__. This guarantees that the companies understand the behavior of the customers and make changes based on the __sentiment__ and therefore, take actions based on insights from the comments and improve the __overall revenue__ of the company respectively.

## Machine Learning and Data Science

Using machine learning techniques and text extraction, we are going to be predicting the sentiment of the text whether it is positive or negative. First, we would be working with the text and check the different words present in the text and once we understand them, we would be performing the machine learning analysis respectively and use the deep neural networks. Then, we are going to be taking those values and performing machine learning operations and getting the predictions as to whether they are positive or negative. 

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
We would be using the __natural language processing__ that is required when doing the machine learning analysis. Performing the natural language processing ensures that the words that are present are converted into mathematical vectors that are used for different macihne learning models for prediction. Once the mathematical vectors are converted into different vectors, they are given for the machine learning models for prediction respectively. Therefore, with the features that are present in the text along with some newly created features, the machine learning and deep learnimg models would be using those techniques and ensures that they are getting the best outputs respectively. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* After performing __exploratory data analysis__, it could be seen based on the results that there are comparatively more number of neutral sentences compared to either positive or negative sentiments. 
* With the use of __word clouds__, it could be seen that words such as good, awesome and great were used most frequently.
* On the contrary, it could ben seen for the negative __word cloud__ that words such as hate, sorry and sad were used most frequently. 

## Vectorizers 

It is important to use vectorizers that are important for machine learning. Therefore, a given text which is in the form of a string is converted into a vectorial representation that is what is being used by machine learning models for prediction. Below are some of the vectorizers that were used in the process of converting a text into a mathematical representation.

* [__Tfidf Vectorizer__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html)

## Machine Learning Models

In this project, there was only one ML model used to get the prediction of the sentiment of tweets. Below is the model that was used for the task of prediction.

* [__Deep Neural Networks__](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model)


## Hyperparameter Tuning 

Once we understand the different machine learning models, we are going to use the hyperparameter tuning which ensures that good set of hyperparameters are selected and this would result in machine learning models that creates the best results respectively. Once we get those important results for the hyperparameters, we are going to use them and ensure that we are getting the best accuracy for the machine learning models. We are going to learn the different hyperparameters and how they influence the machine learning models and the outcome of different problem statements. Therefore, let us now get an understanding of the project and see how these machine learning models are using for production respectively. 

## ðŸ‘‰ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
